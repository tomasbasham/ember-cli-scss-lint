# Ember-cli-scss-lint [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/tomasbasham/ember-cli-scss-lint.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/tomasbasham/ember-cli-scss-lint)

An [Ember CLI](https://ember-cli.com/) addon to integrate [sass-lint](https://github.com/sasstools/sass-lint) for standards adherence and improved style consistency.

One of the many great features of Ember CLI is its rich toolset surrounding the framework such as jshint. This provides you with the ability to more easily write consistent and self documenting code that any developer could understand. However there is currently no similar feature to lint your stylesheets.

If you choose to compose your stylesheets using a preprocessor language such as SCSS you will equally find no support to ensure your code follows best practice. This addon solves this by integrating the `sass-lint` nodejs package into the Ember CLI build process.

Previous versions of this addon made use of the Ruby implementation of [scss-lint](https://github.com/brigade/scss-lint). However the Sass core team is now building Sass in Dart instead of Ruby, and will no longer be maintaining the Ruby implementation. Since `scss-lint` relies on the Ruby Sass implementation, this means it will eventually not support the latest Sass features and bug fixes. As such `sass-lint` has taken over in it's place which offers better integration into an already JavaScript pipeline.

## Installation

From within your Ember CLI project directory run:
```
ember install ember-cli-scss-lint
```

## Usage

Every time you run an Ember CLI process that requires building the application (`ember server`, `ember test`, `ember build`) your stylesheets will be linted and any errors output to the command line.

```

### Configuration

#### sass-lint.yml

Linting can be configured by creating a `.sass-lint.yml` file in the root directory of your Ember CLI project alongside your `.jshintrc` file. If you already have a config for `scss-lint`, you can instantly convert it to the equivalent `sass-lint` config [here](sasstools.github.io/make-sass-lint-config).

##### <a name="configuration-example"></a>Example:

```yml
files:
  include: '**/*.scss'

options:
  formatter: stylish
  merge-default-rules: false

rules:
  border-zero:
    - 1
    - convention: zero

  brace-style:
    - 1
    - allow-single-line: true

  ...
```

#### ember-cli-build.js

Any configuration option you can set within the `.sass-lint.yml` file can also be set within the `ember-cli-build.js` file of the consuming application. Any option here will take precedence over those in the `.sass-lint.yml` file. This is useful when needing to programatically define rule sets depending upon some condition.

##### <a name="configuration-example-js"></a>Example:

```JavaScript
// ember-cli-build.js
var EmberApp = require('ember-cli/lib/broccoli/ember-app');

module.exports = function(defaults) {
  var app = new EmberApp(defaults, {
    scssLintOptions: {
      rules: [
        'border-zero': 2,
        'brace-style': 0
      ]
    }
  });

  return app.toTree();
};
```

For more information on the available rules see the [sass-lint linters documentation](https://github.com/sasstools/sass-lint/tree/master/docs/rules).

#### Adding trees

By default this addon forwards the entire app tree to be linted, but will not lint any files outside of the `app` folder. For most use cases this will be sufficient, but for others this is limiting. If for example you wish to lint files contained within the `vendor` tree you must tell the addon to do so. This can be done within the `ember-cli-build.js` file.

##### <a name="trees-example"></a>Example:

```JavaScript
// ember-cli-build.js
var EmberApp = require('ember-cli/lib/broccoli/ember-app');

module.exports = function(defaults) {
  var app = new EmberApp(defaults, {
    scssLintOptions: {
      includePaths: [
        'vendor'
      ]
    }
  });

  return app.toTree();
};
```
